# ros2-sensor-lite-library

A lightweight, modular library for combining multiple sensors (IMU, odometry, GPS, LIDAR pose, etc.) into a consistent state estimate without forcing users into heavy configs.

ðŸ”‘ Features We Should Implement

1. Pluggable Filters

Complementary filter â†’ simple IMU fusion (gyro + accel).

1D/2D/3D Kalman filter (basic EKF/UKF) â†’ extendable templates.

Custom filter hook â†’ allow user to drop in their own equations.

2. ROS2 Node Interfaces

Subscribes to:

sensor_msgs/Imu

nav_msgs/Odometry

sensor_msgs/NavSatFix

geometry_msgs/PoseStamped

Publishes:

nav_msgs/Odometry (fused state)

geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped

3. Dynamic Configuration

Allow runtime adjustment of noise covariances (similar to dynamic_reconfigure in ROS1).

Example: change IMU trust level on the fly if it starts drifting.

4. Ease of Use

YAML config file with:

which sensors to fuse

noise parameters

update rates

Predefined templates (IMU+Odometry, IMU+GPS, IMU+LIDAR).

5. Extras

Diagnostics (diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticArray) â†’ show which sensor is active / dropped.

Visualization plugin for RViz â†’ fused vs. raw trajectories.
